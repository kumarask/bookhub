"""
Auth Service Package Initialization.

This module initializes the authentication service package. It provides
implementation details, helpers, and shared utilities used across the
package where appropriate.

The code in this module interacts with other parts of the application via
the configured database and the shared pub/sub helper for emitting domain
events.

All public functions and utilities include concise docstrings describing
their arguments, return values, and raised HTTP exceptions where applicable.
